# About the Project:

## Inspiration
We had inspiration from multiple things. One of them is AA sober chips, how it helps people during their withdrawal periods and help people stay on track to not relapse during their recovery journey. Another would be studying apps that reward you with simple small things for studying for a set amount of hours. And the biggest one is Pokemon TCG, intaik is going to have a variety of stickers that are rewarded to users for reaching milestones or goals, and the part that is similar to TCG is that the stickers can be traded between users.

## What it does
1. Rewards for sobriety
2. Stories about celebrities that had a similar addiction and went through recovery and doing much better with the help of GenAI
3. GenAI automatic check-up messages, encouragements and reminders
4. A link to a website called Bored Button ([link](https://www.boredbutton.com)) as a "if you need a distraction from thinking about this stuff, click here".
5. Links to support groups and helplines

## How we built it
We used gemini API for our GenAI, we made our own stickers and used HTML, CSS and JS to make our website. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our problem was figuring out how to implement GenAI on our website. We wanted to make a chat AI that was able to talk to addicts, give them comfort and support, and help them as much as possible

## What's next for intaik
Our website is currently about our GenAI which helps addicts who want to recover and rewards stickers. These stickers have tiers and rarities so the point is to collect rare stickers by staying sober, and other features like celebrity information. In the future we want to add a lot more stickers and make a whole collection, we want to make AI make plans for you (remember you from previous sessions and ask questions to you, check up on you throughout your recovery), make a leaderboard of your achievement during your recovery and be able to compare stickers, make special edition stickers, allow users to chat with each other anonymously with AI moderating the chat to prevent negative interactions, make stickers tradable, find sponsors to keep the website running and be able to give out gift cards and more encouraging rewards than just stickers.




## How to turn on the AI:

### Get Node.js (you just have to do this once):
1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
2. Go to your IDE's terminal, and type the following:
     ##### install express body-parser @google/generative-ai

     ##### npm i cors


### Turn on the server (You must do this every time you want to use the website):
 1. In your IDE's terminal, type the following:
      ##### node .\server.js
